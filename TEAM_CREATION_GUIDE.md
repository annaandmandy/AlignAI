## Database Operations

### When You Create a Team

INSERT INTO teams (name) VALUES ('My Team');

// Adds you as owner
INSERT INTO team_members (team_id, user_id, role)
VALUES (team_id, your_user_id, 'owner');
```

### When You Create a Project

```typescript
// Creates project record
INSERT INTO projects (team_id, name, description, created_by)
VALUES (team_id, 'Project Name', 'Description', your_user_id);

// Automatically creates 7 sections via trigger
INSERT INTO sections (project_id, type, title, order) VALUES
  (project_id, 'problem', 'Problem Statement', 1),
  (project_id, 'target_users', 'Target Users', 2),
  // ... etc for all 7 sections
```

## What Happens Behind the Scenes

### Team Creation Flow

6. Modal closes
7. Refreshes teams list
8. New team appears!

### Project Creation Flow

1. User clicks "Create Project" → Modal opens
2. User enters name and description → Validates name not empty
3. User clicks "Create Project" → Loading state
4. Creates project in database
5. Database trigger creates 7 default sections
6. Redirects to project page (to be built)
7. User sees project in list

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Team created but I'm not seeing it"

**Solution:**
- The modal automatically refreshes the list on close
- If not visible, refresh the page manually
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify in Supabase: Table Editor → teams

### Issue: "Can't create project"

**Check:**
1. Are you on the team detail page? (URL: `/teams/{teamId}`)
2. Does the team_id exist in the database?
3. Are you a member of the team?
4. Check browser console for errors

### Issue: "Project created but shows error"

**Cause:** The project page (`/teams/{teamId}/projects/{projectId}`) doesn't exist yet.

**Solution:** We'll build that next! For now, you can see your projects listed on the team page.

## What's Next?

Now that you can create teams and projects, the next step is to build:

1. **Project Detail Page** - View and manage individual projects
2. **Section Questionnaire** - The 7 product definition sections
3. **AI-Powered Prompts** - Smart questions for each section
4. **Response Collection** - Team members submit their answers
5. **Conflict Detection** - AI identifies misalignments
6. **Consensus Building** - AI helps team reach agreement
7. **PRD Export** - Generate final product document
