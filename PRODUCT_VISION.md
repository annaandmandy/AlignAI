# AlignAI - Product Vision Document

## One-Line Pitch
**AlignAI is your team's shared product brain — an AI co-pilot that ensures everyone's version of the idea is the same.**

## Problem Statement

Teams often fail not because of bad code — but because of misalignment.

At hackathons, early-stage startups, or student projects, team members have different mental versions of:
- Who the target user is
- What the product actually solves
- What features are essential
- What differentiates us from others

**Current Pain Points:**
- Docs are scattered (Notion, Google Docs, Slack)
- Everyone edits separately
- No shared "single source of truth" that stays up-to-date
- Product vision changes silently, and teams lose clarity

## Solution

A collaborative AI agent that helps teams align and evolve their product definition — together.

**AlignAI helps teams:**
1. Capture product vision, users, problems, features, and differentiation
2. Align everyone's mental model through smart guided prompts
3. Detect and summarize differences between team members' inputs
4. Produce clear visual summaries everyone agrees on

## Target Users

| User Type | Their Pain | How AlignAI Helps |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Hackathon Teams** | Chaos in defining product quickly | AI templates + guided discussions produce a one-page "product charter" |
| **Startup Founders / Accelerators** | Hard to unify early team direction | Keeps all product statements consistent + versioned |
| **Student Project Teams** | Unclear division of ideas | Provides structure for roles, goals, and feature sets |
| **Product Mentors / Coaches** | Need to review team ideas fast | Visual summaries and alignment score let mentors instantly spot gaps |

## Core Features (MVP)

### 1. Smart Prompts (AI-guided Discovery Flow)
AI acts like a "product mentor" walking the team through essential questions:
- "Who exactly will use your product?"
- "What key pain point do they face?"
- "Which current solutions do they use?"
- "How is your idea different?"

Each answer is stored as structured data. When multiple members answer, AlignAI compares and shows overlap/differences.

### 2. Visual Summaries ("What We Agreed On")
AI automatically generates:
- One-page Product Overview Canvas (Vision → Problem → Users → Features → Unique Point)
- Word clouds for key terms
- Diagrams showing consensus
- "Team Alignment Gauge" showing similarity/divergence

### 3. AI Conflict Detection
Detects inconsistencies like:
> "Anna described the target user as 'college students', but Jason said 'early professionals'. Do you want to align?"

Suggests AI-generated merged versions and lets the team vote/edit together.

### 4. Real-Time Collaboration
- Multiple members can edit sections
- Comments & suggestions per field
- AI summarizes meeting notes into decision updates

### 5. AI-Generated PRD Snapshot
Once consensus is reached, outputs a one-page "Product Charter":
- Problem & Solution
- Target Users
- Key Features (ranked by importance)
- Competitor Comparison
- Differentiator Summary
- Tech Stack Plan

## Competitive Positioning

| Competitor | Focus | Our Edge |
|------------|-------|----------|
| **Productboard** | Roadmapping & prioritization | Focus on early-stage product alignment before roadmap |
| **Notion** | Docs/wiki | Add AI alignment + consistency checking |
| **ChatPRD** | Spec writing | Go earlier in the funnel — problem & differentiation definition |
| **Miro** | Ideation | Bring AI-guided structure + team version reconciliation |

**Strategy:** Complement ecosystems rather than compete. Integrate data into Notion or export to Productboard.

## Business & Adoption Strategy

| Phase | Goal | Approach |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Hackathon Launch** | Test with student teams | Offer free beta for hackathons (BU Spark!, Major League Hacking, etc.) |
| **Early-Stage Startups** | PM alignment platform | Integrate with Notion / Slack |
| **Accelerators / Incubators** | Team-alignment reporting tool | Use visual summary dashboards for mentors |
| **Monetization** | Freemium model | Free: 1 workspace, AI limit. Pro: multiple teams, unlimited AI calls, export options |

## Roadmap

| Phase | Goal | Key Deliverables | Timeline |
|-------|------|------------------|----------|
| **MVP** | Internal demo for hackathon use | Smart prompts + basic team workspace | 1 month |
| **Alpha** | Add conflict detection + consensus summary | AI-driven visual canvas | 2-3 months |
| **Beta** | Multi-team collaboration, export to PRD | Integration with Notion / Slack | 6 months |
| **Public Launch** | Partner with hackathons or PM courses | Feedback loop & pricing model | TBD |

## Future Extensions

1. **"Product Mentor Mode"** — AI critiques your idea like a PM mentor
2. **Idea Scoring** — AI evaluates clarity and novelty
3. **Persona Generator** — AI builds detailed user personas from basic descriptions
4. **Auto Roadmap** — Given features and target, AI suggests milestone order
